/**
 * Placeholder for @react-three/fiber React 19 compatibility.
 *
 * @react-three/fiber v8 augments the global JSX namespace which no longer
 * exists in @types/react@19. Until R3F is upgraded, StudyPlan3D.tsx uses
 * @ts-nocheck to suppress Three.js JSX element type errors.
 *
 * TODO: Remove this file and the @ts-nocheck in StudyPlan3D.tsx once
 * @react-three/fiber is upgraded to a React 19-compatible version.
