# CI/CD Improvement Todo List

This document outlines the prioritized tasks for improving our Docker and CI/CD workflows based on best practices.

## Phase 1: Foundation Improvements

### High Priority (Next 2 Weeks)

- [x] **Artifact Management**
  - [x] Create GitHub workflow for building and storing immutable Docker images
  - [x] Set up image tagging strategy (commit hash + semantic versioning)
  - [x] Configure caching for node_modules to speed up builds

- [x] **Testing Enhancement**
  - [x] Add container structure tests to validate Docker images
  - [x] Integrate automated linting in CI pipeline
  - [x] Set up parallel test execution for faster feedback

- [x] **Documentation**
  - [x] Create comprehensive Docker usage documentation
  - [x] Document CI/CD workflow and deployment process
  - [x] Add README sections for local development and production deployment

## Phase 2: Delivery Improvements

### Medium Priority (Weeks 3-5)

- [ ] **GitOps Implementation**
  - [ ] Create IaC repository structure
  - [ ] Define Kubernetes/deployment manifests
  - [ ] Set up automated deployment triggered by manifest changes

- [x] **Environment Isolation**
  - [x] Create distinct configurations for dev/staging/production
  - [x] Ensure environment parity across all stages
  - [x] Implement appropriate security boundaries

- [x] **Progressive Delivery**
  - [x] Set up canary deployment capabilities
  - [x] Implement feature flag system
  - [x] Create automated rollback mechanism

## Phase 3: Security & Monitoring

### Medium-Low Priority (Weeks 6-7)

- [x] **Security Enhancement**
  - [x] Integrate SAST tools (SonarQube or similar)
  - [x] Add container vulnerability scanning (Trivy)
  - [x] Implement secrets management with external vault

- [ ] **Monitoring Setup**
  - [ ] Create CI/CD performance dashboard
  - [x] Set up build duration and success rate tracking
  - [ ] Configure alerts for pipeline failures

### Low Priority (Future Improvements)

- [ ] **Advanced Features**
  - [ ] Implement A/B testing capability
  - [ ] Set up chaos testing for resilience validation
  - [ ] Create comprehensive compliance automation

## Resource Requirements

- DevOps engineer time: 1 FTE for 7 weeks
- Developer support: Part-time for testing integration
- Infrastructure costs: ~$300/month for additional services

## Next Steps

1. Address linting and TypeScript errors
2. Create feature flag UI for managing runtime features
3. Set up chaos testing for resilience validation
