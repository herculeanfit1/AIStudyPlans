      question: "How does the AI-powered study plan generator work?",
      answer: "Our platform uses advanced AI algorithms to analyze your learning goals, schedule, and preferences. It then creates a personalized study plan optimized for your needs, suggesting the most effective study times, topics to focus on, and learning methods tailored to your unique learning style."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize my study plan after it's generated?",
      answer: "Absolutely! While our AI creates an optimized initial plan, you have full control to adjust it. You can modify study sessions, change topics, adjust time allocations, or completely restructure your plan. The system will even provide suggestions to maintain effectiveness as you make changes."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this platform suitable for all subjects and education levels?",
      answer: "Yes, our platform supports learners across all education levels from high school to postgraduate studies. It works for virtually any subject, including STEM fields, humanities, languages, test preparation, and professional certifications. The AI adapts its approach based on the specific requirements of your subject and level."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you track my progress and adapt the plan?",
      answer: "As you complete study sessions and exercises, you provide simple feedback on your comprehension and confidence. Our AI analyzes this data along with your completion patterns to automatically adjust your plan, reinforcing challenging areas and optimizing your study schedule for better retention and understanding."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I fall behind on my study schedule?",
      answer: "Life happens! If you miss sessions or fall behind, our system automatically recalibrates your plan. It redistributes topics intelligently, prioritizes critical concepts, and adjusts the schedule to help you catch up without becoming overwhelmed. You can also manually trigger a plan adjustment anytime."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this platform with my existing study materials?",
      answer: "Definitely. You can upload or link to your existing textbooks, notes, online courses, and other study resources. Our system will incorporate these materials into your plan and even suggest when and how to use each resource most effectively in your learning journey."
