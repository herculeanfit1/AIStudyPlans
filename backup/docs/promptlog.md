```

### Response Summary
Created a responsive landing page (index.html) with the following components:
- Modern, branded header with navigation
- Hero section with primary CTA for waitlist signup
- Features section highlighting key product benefits
- How it works section with 4-step process
- Testimonial section with aspirational user feedback
- Waitlist signup form with email capture

### User Request
```
Let's create a Next.js project in this folder.
```

### Response Summary
Converted the static HTML landing page to a Next.js project with the following changes:

1. Created a new Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint
2. Converted the HTML landing page to a React component in `src/app/landing/page.tsx`
3. Updated the layout to include Font Awesome icons and metadata
4. Added redirection from the homepage to the landing page
5. Updated the README.md with Next.js-specific instructions
6. Used proper Next.js components:
   - Replaced regular image tags with Next.js `Image` component
   - Used `useEffect` for client-side interactivity
   - Added 'use client' directive for client components
   - Properly handled TypeScript types

The project now uses modern React patterns and can be expanded with additional functionality while maintaining the same visual design and conversion-focused approach.
