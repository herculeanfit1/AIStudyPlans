- [ ] Prepare rollback strategy
- [ ] Brief team on launch process
- [ ] Set up post-launch monitoring schedule

## Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare Infrastructure**
   - Set up production environment
   - Configure networking and security groups
   - Set up database if applicable

2. **Configure CI/CD**
   - Set up build pipeline
   - Configure deployment steps
   - Add post-deployment tests

3. **Initial Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Run full test suite
   - Verify all functionality

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Execute zero-downtime deployment
   - Verify application health
   - Monitor for errors

5. **Post-Deployment**
   - Run smoke tests
   - Verify analytics tracking
   - Monitor performance and errors
   - Send test emails to verify delivery

## Production Docker Deployment

The application includes a ready-to-use Docker configuration optimized for production deployment:

```bash
# Build the production image
docker build -t aistudyplans:prod .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env.production aistudyplans:prod
```

For container orchestration environments, use the following command to deploy:

```bash
# Using docker-compose for production
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

## Scaling Considerations

- The application is stateless and can be horizontally scaled
- Use a load balancer to distribute traffic
- Consider implementing Redis for session storage if needed
- Configure auto-scaling based on CPU/memory usage
- Use CDN for static assets and media

## Monitoring Strategy

- Set up proactive monitoring for:
  - Application errors
  - API response times
  - Resource usage (CPU, memory)
  - Database performance
  - User engagement metrics
- Create dashboards for key metrics
- Configure alerts for critical issues

## Backup and Recovery

- Implement regular database backups
- Store application state in resilient storage
- Document recovery procedures
- Test restoration process regularly
- Maintain deployment history for rollback

## Maintenance Plan

- Schedule regular maintenance windows
- Plan for zero-downtime updates
- Create communication templates for maintenance notices
- Establish update approval process
- Document rollback procedures
