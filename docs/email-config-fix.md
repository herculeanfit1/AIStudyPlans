# Email Configuration Fix for Waitlist Form

This document outlines the solution implemented to fix the email configuration issue in the waitlist form.

## Problem

The waitlist form on the production site (aistudyplans.com) was showing an "Administrator Notice" warning about Resend API configuration. This happened because:

1. The client-side code was checking for environment variables that are only available server-side
2. There was no public flag to indicate if email was properly configured
3. The administrator notice was showing in production, which is not desired

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive solution with the following components:

### 1. Updated WaitlistForm.tsx Component

- Added a new `isConfigured` state variable that checks for `NEXT_PUBLIC_RESEND_CONFIGURED`
- Modified the admin notice logic to only show in development mode AND when email is not configured
- Added instructions in the admin notice about the new environment variable

### 2. Created Email Configuration API Endpoint

- Added a new `/api/email-config` endpoint that checks server-side email configuration
- Returns boolean status without exposing sensitive values
- Includes a `nextPublicResendConfigured` field for client consumption

### 3. Updated Next.js Configuration

- Added a new environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_RESEND_CONFIGURED` in `next.config.mjs`
- This variable is set based on whether `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`, and `EMAIL_REPLY_TO` are configured

### 4. Updated Azure Deployment

- Created a script (`scripts/update-azure-config.sh`) to update Azure Static Web App settings
- Modified GitHub Actions workflow to set `NEXT_PUBLIC_RESEND_CONFIGURED` during build and deployment
- The value is determined by checking if all required email environment variables are present

## Testing

To test this solution:

1. **Local Development**:
   - In development mode, the admin notice will only show if `NEXT_PUBLIC_RESEND_CONFIGURED` is not set to "true"
   - Set this variable in your `.env.local` file to hide the notice

2. **Production**:
   - Verify that the admin notice doesn't appear in production
   - The notice will be hidden if either:
     - We're in production mode (regardless of configuration)
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_RESEND_CONFIGURED` is set to "true"

3. **Azure Settings**:
   - Run the script to update Azure settings: `./scripts/update-azure-config.sh [webapp-name]`
   - Verify settings were updated with: 
     ```
     az staticwebapp appsettings list --name [webapp-name] --query "[?contains(name, 'RESEND')].{Name:name, Value:value}" -o table
     ```

## How It Works

1. During build/deployment, we check if all required email environment variables are set
2. If they are, we set `NEXT_PUBLIC_RESEND_CONFIGURED` to "true"
3. The WaitlistForm component reads this value and hides the admin notice accordingly
4. Even if the variable is not set, the admin notice won't show in production due to the `isDev` check

## Future Improvements

- Implement a more robust client-side configuration system for feature flags
- Add a full admin dashboard for configuration management
- Create an email testing tool within the application to verify configuration
