# Dependency Update Plan

## Current Issues

Several dependency update attempts failed due to:

1. **Security Updates**:
   - `next-auth@4.24.13` not found (version in original package.json: `4.24.11`)
   - Peer dependency conflicts with Three.js versions

2. **Performance Updates**:
   - Dependency conflict between Chart.js and react-chartjs-2
   - Chart.js was undefined but react-chartjs-2 requires chart.js@^4.1.1

3. **Dev Tools Updates**:
   - No matching version for @playwright/test@1.42.3 (current: 1.42.1)
   - Peer dependency warnings with Next.js

## Resolution Strategy

1. **Fix Immediate Issues**:
   - Created and ran `fix-dependencies.sh` script that:
     - Installs packages individually with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
     - Uses compatible versions that exist in the npm registry
     - Maintains dependency relationships

2. **Long-term Plan**:
   - Update the `update-dependencies.sh` script to use verified version numbers
   - Consider implementing a staging process to test dependency updates before production
   - Look into automated dependency management tools like Dependabot or Renovate

3. **Version Control**:
   - Pin critical dependencies to specific versions to prevent breaking changes
   - Document dependency update attempts in CHANGELOG.md
   - Schedule regular dependency audits to catch security vulnerabilities

## Next Steps

1. Run `./scripts/fix-dependencies.sh` to repair the broken dependencies
2. Verify the application works with `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test`
3. Update the original update scripts with correct version numbers
4. Consider implementing a CI/CD process that includes dependency validation
