# AIStudyPlans Project Status Report

## Overview
AIStudyPlans, branded as "SchedulEd," is a Next.js application designed to generate personalized study plans for students using AI. The application is currently in the early stages of development with a focus on creating the frontend UI components and basic infrastructure. The actual AI-powered study plan generation functionality has not yet been implemented.

## Current Implementation

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router architecture
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Current Pages**:
  - Landing page (`/app/landing/page.tsx`) with marketing content
  - Main page (`/app/page.tsx`) with a study plan preview
  - Dashboard page (`/app/dashboard/page.tsx`) with placeholder content

### UI Components
The application has several React components implemented:
- **Header**: Navigation and branding
- **Footer**: Site links and information
- **Hero**: Main marketing section
- **Features**: Highlights product capabilities
- **Pricing**: Displays subscription tiers and features
- **FAQ**: Common questions and answers
- **WaitlistForm**: For collecting user information pre-launch
- **StudyPlanPreview**: A static mockup showing how generated study plans will look
- **StudyPlanCard**: Card components for displaying study plans in the dashboard
- **StudyTimer**: A Pomodoro-style timer for study sessions
- **Dashboard components**: Layout, sidebar, etc.

### Backend/API
Limited backend implementation:
- **Waitlist API** (`/app/api/waitlist/route.ts`): Endpoint for collecting waitlist signups
- **Email Service** (`/lib/email.ts`): Functionality for sending emails via Resend
- **Email Templates** (`/lib/email-templates.ts`): HTML/text templates for system emails

### Authentication
- Not implemented yet
- Planned to use traditional email/password and OAuth (Google, Microsoft)
- Email functionality for password reset is prepared but not connected

### Study Plan Generation
- Not implemented yet
- Currently only static mockups are displayed
- The PRD outlines an AI-powered generation system with personalization based on:
  - Learning style (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
  - Time availability
  - Knowledge level
  - Subject matter

## Missing Functionality

### Critical Components to Implement
1. **Authentication System**:
   - User registration and login
   - OAuth integration
   - Profile management

2. **AI Study Plan Generation**:
   - Backend API for generating study plans
   - Integration with an AI service (likely an LLM)
   - Customization options based on user preferences

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - Database integration
   - Storing user data, preferences, and generated plans
   - Waitlist database storage (currently logs to console only)

4. **Study Plan Management**:
   - Create, edit, and delete functionality
   - Progress tracking
   - Sharing capabilities

### Secondary Components
- Resource recommendations
- Calendar integration
- Analytics dashboard
- Administrative features
- Content curation system

## Architecture Notes
- The application follows Next.js 14 App Router conventions
- Components are client-side (`'use client'` directive)
- Email functionality is implemented but only used for waitlist signups
- The application is designed to be containerized with Docker

## Next Steps Recommendation
1. Implement user authentication
2. Set up database connectivity
3. Create study plan generation API (likely using an LLM)
4. Implement study plan management
5. Connect frontend components to backend services

## Technical Debt
- Directory structure needs review (some files in `/scheduledapp` subfolder)
- Some placeholder content needs to be replaced with dynamic data
- Testing infrastructure is configured but tests are not implemented

## Documentation
Product Requirements Document (PRD) is available in `.cursor/rules/docs/prd.md` and provides comprehensive details on planned features and architecture.
