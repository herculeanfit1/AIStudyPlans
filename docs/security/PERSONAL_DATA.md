# Personal Information Handling Guidelines

This document outlines best practices for handling personal information in the SchedulEd codebase.

## Types of Personal Information

Personal information that might be processed by the application includes:

1. **Contact information**: Email addresses, names
2. **User preferences**: Study habits, learning styles
3. **Usage data**: Study plans created, features used
4. **Authentication data**: Account credentials (if applicable)

## Guidelines for Code Development

### 1. Minimize Data Collection

- Collect only the personal information necessary for the application to function
- Implement data minimization principles in all features
- Document the purpose of all collected data fields

### 2. Avoid Hardcoding Personal Information

- Never include actual user data in the codebase
- Use placeholder data for testing and development
- Create anonymized sample data for demos

### 3. Secure Storage

- Store personal information in secure databases
- Use encryption for sensitive data
- Implement proper access controls

### 4. Data Handling in Code

When working with personal data in the code:

```javascript
// GOOD: Use generic variable names
const userEmail = process.env.TEST_EMAIL || 'test@example.com';

// BAD: Don't use real personal information in code
const userEmail = 'john.smith@company.com'; // Avoid this!

// GOOD: Always sanitize user inputs
const sanitizedInput = sanitizeHtml(userInput);

// GOOD: Use proper data masking in logs
logger.info(`User logged in: ${maskEmail(email)}`);
```

### 5. Test Data

- Create dedicated test data that doesn't contain real personal information
- Use data generators instead of copying production data
- Implement proper separation between production and test environments

## Compliance with Privacy Laws

The application should be developed with privacy regulations in mind:

1. **GDPR (Europe)**
   - Implement data subject rights (access, deletion, etc.)
   - Document lawful bases for processing
   - Support data portability

2. **CCPA/CPRA (California)**
   - Support "right to know" and "right to delete"
   - Allow users to opt-out of data sales/sharing

3. **General Best Practices**
   - Maintain clear privacy policies
   - Implement consent mechanisms where applicable
   - Document data retention periods

## Security Measures for Personal Data

- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Apply the principle of least privilege for data access
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Regularly audit data access logs

## Incident Response

If a data breach is suspected:

1. Document the details of the suspected breach
2. Report to the security team immediately
3. Do not discuss details publicly
4. Follow the organization's incident response plan

## Review Checklist for Code Changes

When reviewing code that handles personal information:

- [ ] Does the code minimize personal data collection?
- [ ] Is all personal data properly validated and sanitized?
- [ ] Are appropriate privacy notices implemented where data is collected?
- [ ] Is personal data properly encrypted in transit and at rest?
- [ ] Is all personal data access properly logged?
- [ ] Are there mechanisms to delete personal data when requested?

## Personal Information Scanning

Regularly scan the codebase for personal information using:

```bash
# Search for email patterns
grep -r '[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}' --include="*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}" .

# Search for phone number patterns
grep -r '(\+[0-9]{1,3})?[-. ]?(\([0-9]{1,3}\)|[0-9]{1,3})[-. ]?[0-9]{3}[-. ]?[0-9]{4}' --include="*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}" .
```
