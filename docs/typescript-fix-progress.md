# TypeScript and ESLint Fix Progress

## Issues Fixed

1. **Dependencies**:
   - Installed missing type declarations: `@types/uuid`, `@types/express`, `@types/cors`, `@types/helmet`, `@types/pino`, and `@testing-library/jest-dom`
   - Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to resolve conflicting dependencies

2. **Admin Feedback Page**:
   - Added proper typing for filter state
   - Fixed the filter state updates using a spread operator to preserve existing values
   - Created a `FeedbackFilters` interface for better type safety

3. **Admin Login Page**:
   - Added proper TypeScript types for function parameters
   - Fixed unused variables (`showFallback`, `Image` import)
   - Commented out unused function for reference

4. **Contact Page**:
   - Added interfaces for form data and status
   - Added proper event types for form event handlers

5. **Smooth Scroll Utility**:
   - Fixed 'this' type by adding proper `this` parameter to the event handler
   - Changed `MouseEvent` to `Event` to match the expected type

6. **Types System**:
   - Created a dedicated `types.ts` file with proper interfaces
   - Exported reusable types for use across the application

## Remaining Issues

1. **Type Definition Conflicts**:
   - `FeedbackResponse` type has different definitions in `supabase.ts` and `types.ts`
   - `FeedbackWithUser` is missing properties like `email_id` and `waitlist_user_id`

2. **Server Dependencies**:
   - Missing types for the server code: `openai` and `zod`
   - These are only used in the MCP server and not in the main application

3. **Playwright Config**:
   - `maxDiffPixelRatio` is not recognized in the Playwright types
   - This might require a custom type declaration or updating to a newer version

4. **Supabase Client Methods**:
   - TypeScript errors with `.lt()` method and error property extraction
   - These might be resolved by updating the supabase-js types or adding proper type assertions

## Refined Approach

After a thorough review, here's our refined approach to resolve the remaining issues:

### 1. Type Definition Consolidation

- Use interface extensions rather than duplicating definitions
- Update the `FeedbackWithUser` interface to include all required fields:
  ```typescript
  export interface FeedbackWithUser extends FeedbackResponse {
    user: {
      name: string;
      email: string;
      created_at: string;
    };
    email_id?: string;
    waitlist_user_id?: string;
  }
  ```
- Consider using the Supabase CLI to generate types: `npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id <your-id>`

### 2. Server Code Types

- Create a separate `tsconfig.json` for the MCP server code
- Update OpenAI SDK to v4+ which has better TypeScript support
- For Zod, ensure proper imports and consider pinning the version

### 3. Custom Type Declarations

- Create a custom type declaration for Playwright:
  ```typescript
  // playwright.d.ts
  import 'playwright';
  declare module 'playwright' {
    interface PageScreenshotOptions {
      maxDiffPixelRatio?: number;
    }
  }
  ```

### 4. Supabase Client Methods

- Use type assertions where needed with the `as` keyword
- Add proper type guards for Supabase responses

### 5. Gradual Type Strictness

After resolving the current issues, gradually enable stricter type checking:

1. First pass: Fix all existing errors
2. Second pass: Enable `noImplicitAny: true`
3. Third pass: Enable `strictNullChecks: true`

### 6. Developer Experience Improvements

- Enable incremental compilation in tsconfig.json
- Set up a TypeScript linting pre-commit hook
- Document type conventions for the project

## Implementation Priorities

1. Fix type conflicts between `supabase.ts` and `types.ts`
2. Add custom type declarations for Playwright
3. Address Supabase client method typing issues
4. Set up separate configuration for server code
5. Implement gradual type strictness

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Type Definition Conflicts**:
   - Update the `FeedbackWithUser` interface to include all required fields
   - Ensure consistent types between `supabase.ts` and `types.ts`

2. **Server Code Types**:
   - Add types for the server code or add `// @ts-ignore` comments as a temporary measure
   - Consider adding a separate `tsconfig.json` for the server code

3. **ESLint Improvements**:
   - Address remaining unused imports and variables
   - Fix React hook dependency warnings

4. **Testing with Jest**:
   - Ensure Jest tests are properly typed and include DOM matchers
