# Dependency Security Improvements

This document summarizes the comprehensive dependency security improvements implemented in the SchedulEd (AIStudyPlans) project.

## 1. Authentication Dependency Management

### Issue
- **Next-Auth and @auth/core Compatibility**: We identified that next-auth@4.24.11 specifically requires @auth/core@0.34.2, but we were using @auth/core@0.35.1.
- **Legacy Peer Dependencies**: The project was using `--legacy-peer-deps` flag which bypasses npm's dependency resolution, posing security risks.

### Solution
- Created `scripts/fix-auth-deps.sh` that properly resolves the dependencies without using `--legacy-peer-deps`
- Updated the dependency installation order to ensure compatibility
- Updated existing scripts to remove all occurrences of `--legacy-peer-deps`

## 2. NPM Configuration Improvements

### Issue
- Missing standardized npm configuration for consistent and secure package management

### Solution
- Created `.npmrc` with secure settings:
  ```
  audit=true               # Always check for vulnerabilities
  fund=false               # Disable funding messages
  loglevel=warn            # Show warnings and errors only
  package-lock=true        # Always generate package-lock.json
  progress=false           # Disable progress bar for CI systems
  save-exact=true          # Save exact versions
  engine-strict=true       # Enforce Node.js version compatibility
  ignore-scripts=true      # Prevent scripts from running during install (security)
  prefer-offline=true      # Prefer cached packages
  save-prefix=""           # Don't use ~ or ^ prefixes
  ```

## 3. Validation Library Integration

### Issue
- Missing central validation system despite having validation-related code

### Solution
- Added Zod for schema-based validation
- Verified that the proper version (3.22.4) is installed
- Created installation and setup script (`scripts/install-zod.sh`)
- Added a React hook for client-side validation (`lib/hooks/useFormValidation.ts`)
- Documented usage with `docs/zod-installation-checklist.md`

## 4. Automated Security Checks

### Issue
- No automated process to check for dependency security issues

### Solution
- Created `scripts/check-deps-security.sh` for comprehensive dependency checks
- Added npm scripts: `security:deps` and `security:fix-auth`
- Created GitHub Actions workflow for dependency security scanning
- Integrated multiple security scanning tools (npm audit, Snyk, OWASP Dependency Check)

## 5. Documentation and Standards

### Issue
- Lack of documented standards for dependency management

### Solution
- Created comprehensive `docs/dependency-security-strategy.md` with:
  - Core principles for dependency management
  - Authentication dependency compatibility guidelines
  - NPM configuration standards
  - Security scanning procedures
  - Update process documentation
  - Azure Static Web Apps integration notes
  - Incident response procedures

## 6. Dependencies Update Process

### Issue
- Inconsistent approach to updating dependencies

### Solution
- Updated `scripts/fix-dependencies.sh` to handle dependency fixes safely
- Updated `scripts/update-dependencies.sh` to remove legacy-peer-deps and handle auth packages properly
- Added verification steps after dependency updates

## Implementation Verification

All scripts include extensive error checking and validation to ensure that:

1. Authentication dependencies are compatible
2. No legacy peer dependency flags are used
3. Dependencies are regularly audited for vulnerabilities
4. Validation libraries are properly installed and configured

## Next Steps

1. Run `./scripts/fix-auth-deps.sh` to fix the authentication dependency conflict
2. Run `./scripts/check-deps-security.sh` to verify all dependencies are secure
3. Implement client-side validation using the new validation hook
4. Configure the GitHub Actions workflow with appropriate secrets
5. Consider adding dependency monitoring service integration (Dependabot, Renovate)
