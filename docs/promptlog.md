### User Request

```
Let's create a Next.js project in this folder.
```

### Response Summary

Converted the static HTML landing page to a Next.js project with the following changes:

1. Created a new Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint
2. Converted the HTML landing page to a React component in `src/app/landing/page.tsx`
3. Updated the layout to include Font Awesome icons and metadata
4. Added redirection from the homepage to the landing page
5. Updated the README.md with Next.js-specific instructions
6. Used proper Next.js components:
   - Replaced regular image tags with Next.js `Image` component
   - Used `useEffect` for client-side interactivity

### User Request

```
Next, do comprehensive documentation of the codebase. WIth this one, PLEASE make sure to consolidate documentation wherever possible. I want comprehensive, but consolidated, so I/you are not looking everywhere for it.
```

### Response Summary

Created comprehensive documentation for the AIStudyPlans codebase:

1. Created `CODEBASE.md` with overall architecture, project structure, and implementation details
2. Created `API.md` with API endpoints, request/response formats, and implementation notes
3. Created `EMAIL.md` with email service configuration, templates, and utility functions
4. Created `COMPONENTS.md` with frontend components documentation, including props, state, and usage examples
5. Updated `README.md` as a central entry point linking to all documentation files

Consolidated and removed redundant documentation:

- Removed `email-system.md`, `email-service.md`, and `env-example.md` as their content was integrated into the new documentation files
- Updated `TODO.md` to mark the comprehensive documentation task as completed
- Created `promptlog.md` to track user prompts and interactions

The documentation now follows a clean, consistent format with appropriate markdown formatting, code examples, and tables. Each document provides specific, focused information about its area while maintaining connections to the broader system architecture.
