### User Request
```
I want to create a high conversion landing page for a company called SchedulEd, details of which are attached in the document. And I'd like a call to action for a sign up to a wait list for the product because it hasn't launched yet.
```

### Response Summary
Created a responsive landing page (index.html) with the following components:
- Modern, branded header with navigation
- Hero section with primary CTA for waitlist signup
- Features section highlighting key product benefits
- How it works section with 4-step process
- Testimonial section with aspirational user feedback
- Waitlist signup form with email capture
- Footer with company information and links
- Mobile-responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Simple JavaScript for menu toggle and form handling

The page focuses on converting visitors to waitlist signups by emphasizing the AI-powered personalized study plan benefits from the PRD document.

### User Request
```
Let's create a Next.js project in this folder.
```

### Response Summary
Converted the static HTML landing page to a Next.js project with the following changes:

1. Created a new Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint
2. Converted the HTML landing page to a React component in `src/app/landing/page.tsx`
3. Updated the layout to include Font Awesome icons and metadata
4. Added redirection from the homepage to the landing page
5. Updated the README.md with Next.js-specific instructions
6. Used proper Next.js components:
   - Replaced regular image tags with Next.js `Image` component
   - Used `useEffect` for client-side interactivity
   - Added 'use client' directive for client components
   - Properly handled TypeScript types

The project now uses modern React patterns and can be expanded with additional functionality while maintaining the same visual design and conversion-focused approach.

Please revite current cursor rules for the project and verify that youare adhering to them. Then, suggest any changes. Otherwise, I'd like to get the nextjs up
```

### Response Summary
Reviewed and implemented changes to comply with the cursor rules defined in `.cursor/rules/master-coding-preferences.mdc`:

1. **Project Structure Improvements**:
   - Created separate `src/components` directory for reusable components
   - Created `src/lib` directory for utility functions
   - Extracted Header and WaitlistForm into dedicated components
   - Extracted smooth scrolling functionality into a utility function

2. **TypeScript Configuration**:
   - Ensured strict type checking is enabled in tsconfig.json

3. **Styling Improvements**:
   - Added Prettier configuration with Tailwind CSS plugin for class sorting
   - Maintained consistent class naming and structure

4. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Added `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative Font Awesome icons

5. **Updated Code Organization**:
   - Ensured files follow the rule of staying under 150 lines where possible
   - Implemented proper separation of concerns

### User Request
```
Next, do comprehensive documentation of the codebase. WIth this one, PLEASE make sure to consolidate documentation wherever possible. I want comprehensive, but consolidated, so I/you are not looking everywhere for it.
```

### Response Summary
Created comprehensive documentation for the AIStudyPlans codebase:

1. Created `CODEBASE.md` with overall architecture, project structure, and implementation details
2. Created `API.md` with API endpoints, request/response formats, and implementation notes
3. Created `EMAIL.md` with email service configuration, templates, and utility functions
4. Created `COMPONENTS.md` with frontend components documentation, including props, state, and usage examples
5. Updated `README.md` as a central entry point linking to all documentation files

Consolidated and removed redundant documentation:
- Removed `email-system.md`, `email-service.md`, and `env-example.md` as their content was integrated into the new documentation files
- Updated `TODO.md` to mark the comprehensive documentation task as completed
- Created `promptlog.md` to track user prompts and interactions

The documentation now follows a clean, consistent format with appropriate markdown formatting, code examples, and tables. Each document provides specific, focused information about its area while maintaining connections to the broader system architecture.

## May 4, 2025 - Implemented Local LLM Development with MCP

**User**: Setup global MCP server configuration to connect Cursor with local Qwen3 Coder model at http://10.1.10.98:1234/v1 to avoid Claude token costs

**Action**: Implemented and configured a secure MCP integration with the following components:
- Global MCP configuration in `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/settings.json`
- Added documentation for MCP server usage in the main README.md
- Added section in docs/README.md about local LLM development workflow
- Integrated the local LLM development approach into the PRD
- Ensured all new configurations include appropriate documentation/comments

**Result**: Successfully set up a direct connection to the local Qwen3 Coder model via Cursor's MCP protocol, eliminating cloud token usage and enabling local AI-powered development.
